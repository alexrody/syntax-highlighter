# Syntax Highlighter

The program receives a text file containing code in C++, Python or JavaScript and outputs an HTML file containing the same code and highlighting elements from lexical categories that are shared between the three languages.

Note that an exception is yet to be implemented so C++ and JavaScript comments can be told apart from Python integer divisions (//).
